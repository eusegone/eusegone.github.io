Born in Caracas, Venezuela. I have developed a love for learning languages and meeting people. I lived in Madeira for a short time, before moving to the UK. As a student in the UK I helped other foreign students who had trouble with the English language, mainly Portuguese or Spanish speakers. During this time I observed the expansion of the tech sector and after seeing the endless possibilities on offer, I decided to enrol on the web
development course at GA. Having developed my skills as a junior web developer I am now looking forward to working in a team and being able to develop my skills further. I am passionate about joining a growing team with a high octane feel, whether itâ€™s a start-up or larger organisation.
