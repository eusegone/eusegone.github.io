										<h3>Restaurant Recipe</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Having opened two restaurants and seeing how difficult it is to compete against the larger organisations, I wanted to make something that would help small businesses to flourish, Restaurant Recipe was created with that in mind.</p>
									<p>The idea is simple, using your mobile or tablet, the user would sign in, and locate one self using google maps. Once the user has been found, look at the list of restaurants around you and choose what you would like to do.  Either book a table or look at the recipes that the restaurant has published.  If you see one you like, why not prepare it at home, and see how much of a chef you are. </p>
									<p>The app was put together using Javascript, Ruby, HTML5, Twitter Bootstarp, Google Maps API and my love and dediaction.</p>

										<h3><strong>DJ Tracks</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>The first project that I carried out was "DJ Tracks" where a user could upload music and leave coments, if they register. Used Ruby and act as comentable gem was the biggest challenge.</p>
